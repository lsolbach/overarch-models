# Proactive failure notification (Concept)
## Description
Set proactive failure notifications to identify critical issues and act on problems before they arise.

## Documentation
Proactive failure notification is the practice of generating
notifications when monitored values approach known failure thresholds,
and not waiting for the system to alert you it has already failed — or
worse, to find out from customers that your application or service is
down. Using this approach, you can identify and potentially resolve
issues before they become serious or start to impact your users. The 2014
DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) research showed that proactive
monitoring is a significant predictor of software delivery performance.
According to DORA research, teams that use proactive notification can diagnose
and solve problems quickly. When failures are instead primarily reported by a
source external to the operations team, such as by the network operations
center (NOC) — or worse, by customers — rather than internal monitoring,
performance suffers.

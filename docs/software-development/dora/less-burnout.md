## Documentation
Burnout is physical, mental, or emotional exhaustion caused by overwork or stress.
But it’s more than just being overworked or stressed. Burnout can make the things
we once loved about our work and life seem insignificant and dull. It often
manifests itself as a feeling of helplessness, and is correlated with
pathological cultures and unproductive, wasteful work. Dr. Christina Maslach,
professor of psychology at the University of California at Berkeley and a
pioneering researcher on job burnout, found six organizational risk factors
that predict burnout:

* Work overload. Job demands that exceed human limits.
* Lack of control. Inability to influence decisions that affect your job.
* Insufficient rewards. Insufficient financial, institutional, or social rewards.
* Breakdown of community. Unsupportive workplace environment.
* Absence of fairness. Lack of fairness in decision-making processes.
* Value conflicts. Mismatch in organizational values and the individual’s values.

Maslach found that most organizations try to fix the person and ignore the work
environment, even though data shows that fixing the environment has a higher
likelihood of success. Management has the power to change all of these risk factors.

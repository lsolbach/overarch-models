## Description
Shows a concept map of the DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) State of DevOps model

## Concepts
| Concept | Description |
|---|---|
| [Change fail rate](../../software-development/dora/change-fail-rate.md)| What percentage of changes to production or released to users result in degraded service (e.g., lead to service impairment or service outage) and subsequently require remediation (e.g., require a hotfix, rollback, fix forward, patch)? |
| [Change lead time](../../software-development/dora/change-lead-time.md)| How long does it take to go from code committed to code successfully running in production? |
| [Commercial performance](../../software-development/dora/commercial-performance.md)|  |
| [Deployment frequency](../../software-development/dora/deployment-frequency.md)| How often does your organization deploy code to production or release it to end users? |
| [How to empower software delivery teams as a business leader](../../software-development/dora/empower-software-delivery-teams-as-a-business-leader.md)|  |
| [How to transform](../../software-development/dora/how-to-transform.md)|  |
| [Less burnout](../../software-development/dora/less-burnout.md)| Less physical, mental, or emotional exhaustion caused by overwork or stress |
| [Less deployment pain](../../software-development/dora/less-deployment-pain.md)| A measure of the fear and anxiety that engineers and technical staff feel when they push code into production |
| [Less rework](../../software-development/dora/less-rework.md)| Fixing things that werenâ€™t done right the first time and, like change fail rate, is a proxy measure for quality. |
| [Non-Commercial performance](../../software-development/dora/non-commercial-performance.md)|  |
| [Organizational performance](../../software-development/dora/organizational-performance.md)| Measures the ability of an organization to achieve commercial and non-commercial goals |
| [Software delivery performance](../../software-development/dora/software-delivery-performance.md)| Software delivery performance is the ability to develop and deliver software with speed and stability. |
| [Time to restore service](../../software-development/dora/time-to-restore-service.md)| How long does it generally take to restore service when a service incident or a defect that impacts users occurs (e.g., unplanned outage, service impairment)? |

## Other Relationships

|---|---|---|---|
| [Commercial performance](../../software-development/dora/commercial-performance.md) | leads to | [Organizational performance](../../software-development/dora/organizational-performance.md) |  |

| [Time to restore service](../../software-development/dora/time-to-restore-service.md) | measure for | [Software delivery performance](../../software-development/dora/software-delivery-performance.md) |  |
| [Change fail rate](../../software-development/dora/change-fail-rate.md) | measure for | [Software delivery performance](../../software-development/dora/software-delivery-performance.md) |  |

# Learning culture (Concept)
## Description
Grow a learning culture and understand its impact on your organizational performance.

## Documentation
Research from the DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) team shows that an organizational culture that values learning contributes to software delivery performance with the following:

    * Increased deployment frequency
    * Reduced lead time for changes, time to restore service, and change failure rate
    * Strong team culture

The climate for learning in your organization is directly related to the extent to which your organization treats learning as strategic:

    * Does your organization view learning as an investment necessary for growth?
    * Is learning seen as a necessary burden, undertaken only grudgingly?
    * Is learning completely avoided?

Research done in other areas, such as accounting, has also shown that a climate for learning is predictive of performance gains.

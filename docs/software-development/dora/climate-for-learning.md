# Climate for Learning (Concept)
## Description
A key predictor of software delivery performance

## Documentation
A climate for learning is a key predictor of software delivery performance. A climate for learning is a work environment where it is safe to learn from mistakes, where people are encouraged to experiment, and where there is a high degree of trust. A climate for learning is part of a wider group of capabilities, including team experimentation, working in small batches, and visibility of work in the value stream, that together represent a lean approach to product management. When these capabilities are applied together, they help predict software delivery performance and organizational performance.

# Software delivery performance (Concept)
## Description
Software delivery performance is the ability to develop and deliver software with speed and stability.

## Documentation
DORA’s research has consistently found that a team’s software delivery capability
reliably predicts the value that the team provides to their organization.
Survey respondents who achieve high levels of software delivery performance
report that their organizations perform better on business objectives.
Performance can be assessed according to four software delivery metrics:

## Documentation
Monitoring is the process of collecting, analyzing, and using information
to track applications and infrastructure in order to guide business decisions.
Monitoring is a key capability because it gives you insight into your systems
and your work. Properly implemented, monitoring also gives you rapid feedback
so that you can quickly find and fix problems early in the software development
lifecycle.

Monitoring also helps you communicate information about your systems to people
in other areas of the software development and delivery pipeline, and to other
parts of the business. Knowledge acquired downstream in operations might get
integrated into upstream teams, such as development and product management.
For example, the knowledge gained from operating a highly scalable application
that uses a NoSQL database as a data store can be valuable information for
developers as they build a similar application.

This knowledge transfer allows teams to quickly identify learnings, whether
they stem from a production issue, a deployment error, or your customer usage
patterns. You can then share these learnings across your organization to help
people and systems improve.

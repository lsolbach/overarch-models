## Documentation
Every organization is constantly undergoing change. Therefore, some questions to ask are:

    * What is the direction of that change?
    * What are the system-level outcomes you are working towards?
    * Is the organization better able to discover and serve its customers, and thus achieve its purpose?
    * Does the organization’s business model and management of its people provide long-term sustainability?

When it seems as if things aren’t going to plan, it’s common for leaders to roll out a transformation program. However, these programs often fail to achieve their goals, using up large quantities of resources and organizational capacity. This document examines how to successfully execute a transformation and addresses some common sources of failure.

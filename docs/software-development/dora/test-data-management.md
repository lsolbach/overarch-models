# Test data management (Concept)
## Description
Understand the right strategies for managing test data effectively along with approaches to provide fast, secure data access for testing.

## Documentation
Automated testing is a key component of modern software delivery practices. The ability to execute a comprehensive set of unit, integration, and system tests is essential to verify that your app or service behaves as expected, and can be safely deployed to production. To ensure that your tests are validating realistic scenarios, it’s critical to supply the tests with realistic data.

Test data is important because it’s required by all kinds of tests throughout your test suite, including manual and automated tests. Good test data lets you validate common or high value user journeys, test for edge cases, reproduce defects, and simulate errors.

However, it’s hard to use and manage test data effectively. Over-reliance on data defined outside of test scope can make your tests brittle and increase maintenance costs. Dependencies on external data sources can introduce delays and impact test performance. Copying production data introduces risk because it might contain sensitive information. To address these challenges, you need to manage your test data carefully and strategically.

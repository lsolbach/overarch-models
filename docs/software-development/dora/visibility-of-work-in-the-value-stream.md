## Documentation
Visibility of work represents the extent to which teams have a good understanding of the flow of work from the business all the way through to customers, and whether they have visibility into this flow, including the status of products and features. Visibility of work is part of a wider group of capabilities that represent lean product management; these capabilities include working in small batches, team experimentation, and visibility into customer feedback. These capabilities predict both software delivery performance and organizational performance (which is measured in terms of profitability, market share, and productivity).

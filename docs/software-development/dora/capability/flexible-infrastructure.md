## Documentation
Infrastructure flexibility is often a motivation for organizations to adopt cloud computing. However, the use of a cloud provider alone may not be sufficient to achieve the desired agility. DORA’s research uses a definition from The USA’s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to establish the five essential characteristics that enable cloud computing to provide its full potential benefit to an organization:
  
      * On-demand self-service
      * Broad network access
      * Resource pooling
      * Rapid elasticity
      * Measured service

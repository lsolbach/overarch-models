## Documentation
Fast feedback is a key predictor of software delivery performance.
Fast feedback is the ability to get information about the impact of a change
quickly. Fast feedback is part of a wider group of capabilities, including
working in small batches, team experimentation, and visibility of work in the
value stream, that together represent a lean approach to product management.
When these capabilities are applied together, they help predict software
delivery performance and organizational performance.

## Documentation
A climate for learning is a key predictor of software delivery performance.
A climate for learning is a work environment where it is safe to learn from
mistakes, where people are encouraged to experiment, and where there is a high
degree of trust. A climate for learning is part of a wider group of
capabilities, including team experimentation, working in small batches, and
visibility of work in the value stream, that together represent a lean approach
to product management. When these capabilities are applied together, they help
predict software delivery performance and organizational performance.

## Documentation
Fast flow is a key predictor of software delivery performance. Fast flow is
the movement of work from development through testing and deployment into
operations. Fast flow is part of a wider group of capabilities, including
working in small batches, team experimentation, and visibility of work in the
value stream, that together represent a lean approach to product management.
When these capabilities are applied together, they help predict software
delivery performance and organizational performance.

## Documentation
Software systems are complex, and an apparently simple, self-contained change to a single file can have unintended side effects on the overall system. When a large number of developers work on related systems, coordinating code updates is a hard problem, and changes from different developers can be incompatible.
  
  The practice of continuous integration (CI) was created to address these problems. CI follows the principle that if something takes a lot of time and energy, you should do it more often, forcing you to make it less painful. By creating rapid feedback loops and ensuring that developers work in small batches, CI enables teams to produce high quality software, to reduce the cost of ongoing software development and maintenance, and to increase the productivity of the teams.

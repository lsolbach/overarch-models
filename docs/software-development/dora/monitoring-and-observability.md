# Monitoring and Observability (Concept)
## Description
Learn how to build tooling to help you understand and debug your production systems.

## Documentation
Good monitoring is a staple of high-performing teams. DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) research shows that a comprehensive monitoring and observability solution, along with a number of other technical practices, positively contributes to continuous delivery.

DORAâ€™s research defined these terms as follows:

Monitoring is tooling or a technical solution that allows teams to watch and understand the state of their systems. Monitoring is based on gathering predefined sets of metrics or logs.

Observability is tooling or a technical solution that allows teams to actively debug their system. Observability is based on exploring properties and patterns not defined in advance.

To do a good job with monitoring and observability, your teams should have the following:

    * Reporting on the overall health of systems (Are my systems functioning? Do my systems have sufficient resources available?).
    * Reporting on system state as experienced by customers (Do my customers know if my system is down and have a bad experience?).
    * Monitoring for key business and systems metrics.
    * Tooling to help you understand and debug your systems in production.
    * Tooling to find information about things you did not previously know (that is, you can identify unknown unknowns).
    * Access to tools and data that help trace, understand, and diagnose infrastructure problems in your production environment, including interactions between services.

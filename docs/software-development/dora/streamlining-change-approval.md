# Streamlining change approval (Concept)
## Description
Replace heavyweight change-approval processes with peer review, to get the benefits of a more reliable, compliant release process without sacrificing speed.

## Documentation
Most IT organizations have change management processes to manage the life cycle of changes to IT services, both internal and customer-facing. These processes are often the primary controls to reduce the operational and security risks of change.

Change management processes often include approvals by external reviewers or change approval boards (CABs) to promote changes through the system.

Compliance managers and security managers rely on change management processes to validate compliance requirements, which typically require evidence that all changes are appropriately authorized.

Research by DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA), presented in the 2019 State of DevOps Report (PDF), finds that change approvals are best implemented through peer review during the development process, supplemented by automation to detect, prevent, and correct bad changes early in the software delivery life cycle. Techniques such as continuous testing, continuous integration, and comprehensive monitoring and observability provide early and automated detection, visibility, and fast feedback.

Further, organizations can improve their performance by doing a better job of communicating the existing process and helping teams navigate it efficiently. When team members have a clear understanding of the change approval process, this drives higher performance.

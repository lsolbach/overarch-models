# Fast Flow (Concept)
## Description
A key predictor of software delivery performance.

## Documentation
Fast flow is a key predictor of software delivery performance. Fast flow is the movement of work from development through testing and deployment into operations. Fast flow is part of a wider group of capabilities, including working in small batches, team experimentation, and visibility of work in the value stream, that together represent a lean approach to product management. When these capabilities are applied together, they help predict software delivery performance and organizational performance.

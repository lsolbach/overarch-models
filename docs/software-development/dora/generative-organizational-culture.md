## Documentation
According to research by DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA), organizational culture that is high-trust and emphasizes information flow is predictive of software delivery performance and organizational performance in technology. The idea that a good culture that optimizes information flow is predictive of good outcomes is not a new idea; it is based on research by sociologist Dr. Ron Westrum. Westrum’s research included human factors in system safety, particularly in the context of accidents in technological domains such as aviation and healthcare.

In his work with these high risk, highly complex fields, Westrum noted that such a culture influences the way information flows through an organization. Westrum provides three characteristics of good information:

    1. It provides answers to the questions that the receiver needs answered.
    2. It is timely.
    3. It is presented in such a way that the receiver can use it effectively.

In his research, he developed the following typology of organizational cultures.
         
Pathological | Bureaucratic | Generative
---|---|---
Power oriented | Rule oriented | Performance oriented
Low cooperation | Modest cooperation | High cooperation
Messengers “shot” | Messengers neglected | Messengers trained
Responsibilities shirked | Narrow responsibilities | Risks are shared
Bridging discouraged | Bridging tolerated | Bridging encouraged
Failure leads to scapegoating | Failure leads to justice | Failure leads to inquiry
Novelty crushed | Novelty leads to problems | Novelty implemented

Similar to Dr. Westrum’s findings, DORA research shows that a high-trust, generative culture predicts software delivery and organizational performance in technology.

Research from a large two-year study at Google found similar results: that high performing teams need a culture of trust and psychological safety, meaningful work, and clarity. In the 2019 State of DevOps Report further analysis shows that a culture of psychological safety is predictive of software delivery performance, organizational performance, and productivity.

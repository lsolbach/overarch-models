## Documentation
Deployment pain is a measure of the fear and anxiety that engineers and technical staff feel when they push code into production. It also measures the extent to which deployments are disruptive rather than easy and pain-free. Where deployments are most painful, youâ€™ll find the poorest software delivery performance, organizational performance, and organizational culture.

Teams can reduce deployment pain by implementing the technical practices that drive continuous delivery. Put another way, the technical practices that improve our ability to deliver software with both speed and stability also reduce the stress and anxiety associated with pushing code into production.

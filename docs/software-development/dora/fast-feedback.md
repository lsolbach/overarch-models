# Fast Feedback (Concept)
## Description
A key predictor of software delivery performance.


## Documentation
Fast feedback is a key predictor of software delivery performance. Fast feedback is the ability to get information about the impact of a change quickly. Fast feedback is part of a wider group of capabilities, including working in small batches, team experimentation, and visibility of work in the value stream, that together represent a lean approach to product management. When these capabilities are applied together, they help predict software delivery performance and organizational performance.

## Description
Shows the concepts of Complexity and their relations

## Concepts
| Concept | Description |
|---|---|
| [ Coupling ](../../software-development/complexity/coupling.md)| Coupling is the degree of interdependence between software modules; the strength of the relationships between modules. |
| [Accidental Complexity](../../software-development/complexity/accidental-complexity.md)| complexity caused by the design or implementation of the software system. |
| [Cohesion](../../software-development/complexity/cohesion.md)| Cohesion is the degree to which the elements inside a module belong together; the strength of the relationships within a module. |
| [Complexity](../../software-development/complexity/complexity.md)| degree of interdependence between software modules. |
| [Connascence](../../software-development/complexity/connascence/connascence.md)| A software quality metric that measures the degree of coupling between software modules |
| [Inherent Complexity](../../software-development/complexity/inherent-complexity.md)| complexity intrinsic to the problem domain. |

## Generalizations
| From | Name | To | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Inherent Complexity](../../software-development/complexity/inherent-complexity.md) | is a | [Complexity](../../software-development/complexity/complexity.md) | type of complexity |
| [Accidental Complexity](../../software-development/complexity/accidental-complexity.md) | is a | [Complexity](../../software-development/complexity/complexity.md) | type of complexity |

## Other Relationships
| From | Name | To | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| [ Coupling ](../../software-development/complexity/coupling.md) | leads to | [Accidental Complexity](../../software-development/complexity/accidental-complexity.md) |  |
| [Connascence](../../software-development/complexity/connascence/connascence.md) | measure of | [ Coupling ](../../software-development/complexity/coupling.md) | coupling between software modules |

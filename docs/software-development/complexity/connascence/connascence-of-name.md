## Documentation
Connascence of Name is a type of connascence that occurs when two or more modules
must agree on the name of a variable, constant, or method.
  
Java Example:
```java
public class Math {
  public static double square(double x) {
    return x * x;
  }
}
  
public class Shape {
  public double area(double x) {
    return Math.square(x);
  }
}
```

In this example, the `Shape` class depends on the `Math` class, and the `Shape`
class must agree on the name of the `square` method in the `Math` class.

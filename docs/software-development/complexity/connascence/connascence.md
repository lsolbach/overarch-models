## Documentation
Connascence is a software quality metric that measures the degree of
coupling between software modules.
It is a measure of the strength of the relationships between modules.
Connascences have the properties degree, strength, and locality.
  
There are several types of connascence, including connascence of name,
connascence of meaning, connascence of type, connascence of position,
connascence of value, connascence of algorithm, connascence of execution,
connascence of identity, connascence of time, connascence of space, connascence
of implementation, connascence of interface, and connascence of protocol.

## Description
Shows the concepts of Connascence and their relations

## Concepts
| Concept | Description |
|---|---|
| [ Coupling ](../../../software-development/complexity/coupling.md)| Coupling is the degree of interdependence between software modules; the strength of the relationships between modules. |
| [Connascence](../../../software-development/complexity/connascence/connascence.md)| A software quality metric that measures the degree of coupling between software modules |
| [Connascence Degree](../../../software-development/complexity/connascence/connascence-degree.md)| measures the degree of coupling between two software modules |
| [Connascence Locality](../../../software-development/complexity/connascence/connascence-locality.md)| measures the locality of connascence between two software modules |
| [Connascence Strength](../../../software-development/complexity/connascence/connascence-strength.md)| measures the strength of the relationship between two software modules |
| [Connascence of Algorithm](../../../software-development/complexity/connascence/connascence-of-algorithm.md)| occurs when two or more modules must agree on the algorithm used to solve a problem |
| [Connascence of Execution](../../../software-development/complexity/connascence/connascence-of-execution.md)| occurs when two or more modules must agree on the order in which they are executed |
| [Connascence of Identity](../../../software-development/complexity/connascence/connascence-of-identity.md)| occurs when two or more modules must agree on the identity of an object |
| [Connascence of Meaning](../../../software-development/complexity/connascence/connascence-of-meaning.md)| occurs when two or more modules must agree on the meaning of a variable, constant, or method. |
| [Connascence of Name](../../../software-development/complexity/connascence/connascence-of-name.md)| occurs when two or more modules must agree on the name of a variable, constant, or method |
| [Connascence of Position](../../../software-development/complexity/connascence/connascence-of-position.md)| occurs when two or more modules must agree on the position of a variable, constant, or method |
| [Connascence of Time](../../../software-development/complexity/connascence/connascence-of-time.md)| occurs when two or more modules must agree on the timing of an event |
| [Connascence of Type](../../../software-development/complexity/connascence/connascence-of-type.md)| occurs when two or more modules must agree on the type of a variable, constant, or method |
| [Connascence of Value](../../../software-development/complexity/connascence/connascence-of-value.md)| occurs when two or more modules must agree on the value of a variable, constant, or method |
| [Dynamic Connascence](../../../software-development/complexity/connascence/dynamic-connascence.md)| depends on the runtime attributes of the cod |
| [Static Connascence](../../../software-development/complexity/connascence/static-connascence.md)| does not depend on the runtime attributes of the code |

## Documentation
Coupling is the degree of interdependence between software modules.
It is a measure of the strength of the relationships between modules, of how closely connected two routines or modules are.
There are several types of coupling, including data coupling, control coupling.
The goal of software design is to minimize coupling, which reduces complexity
and makes the system easier to understand and maintain.

Coupling can be measured by Connascence.

## Description
Shows the concepts of the Twelve Factor App and their relationships.

## Concepts
| Concept | Description |
|---|---|
| [12 Factor App](../../software-development/twelve-factor-app/twelve-factor-app.md)| is a methodology for building software-as-a-service applications |
| [Admin Processes](../../software-development/twelve-factor-app/admin-processes.md)| Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes |
| [Backing Services](../../software-development/twelve-factor-app/backing-services.md)| Treat backing services as attached resources |
| [Build, Release, Run](../../software-development/twelve-factor-app/build-release-run.md)| Strictly separate build and run stages |
| [Codebase](../../software-development/twelve-factor-app/codebase.md)| One codebase tracked in revision control, many deploys |
| [Concurrency](../../software-development/twelve-factor-app/concurrency.md)| Scale out via the process model |
| [Config](../../software-development/twelve-factor-app/config.md)| Store config in the environment |
| [Dependencies](../../software-development/twelve-factor-app/dependencies.md)| Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies |
| [Dev/Prod Parity](../../software-development/twelve-factor-app/dev-prod-parity.md)| Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible |
| [Disposability](../../software-development/twelve-factor-app/disposability.md)| Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown |
| [Logs](../../software-development/twelve-factor-app/logs.md)| Treat logs as event streams |
| [Port Binding](../../software-development/twelve-factor-app/port-binding.md)| Export services via port binding |
| [Processes](../../software-development/twelve-factor-app/processes.md)| Execute the app as one or more stateless processes |

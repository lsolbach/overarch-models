## Description
Shows the concepts related to cloud deployment models and their relationships.

## Concepts
| Concept | Description |
|---|---|
| [Cloud Deployment Model](../../../software-development/cloud/cloud-deployment-model.md)| Cloud deployment models include Public Cloud, Private Cloud, Hybrid Cloud, and Multi-Cloud. |
| [Hybrid Cloud](../../../software-development/cloud/deployment-model/hybrid-cloud.md)| A cloud computing environment that combines public cloud services with private cloud services. |
| [Multi-Cloud](../../../software-development/cloud/deployment-model/multi-cloud.md)| A cloud computing strategy that involves using multiple cloud services from different providers. |
| [On Premises](../../../software-development/cloud/deployment-model/on-premises.md)| Refers to the deployment of software or services on a company's own hardware or servers, rather than on a cloud provider's infrastructure. |
| [Private Cloud](../../../software-development/cloud/deployment-model/private-cloud.md)| Type of cloud computing in which resources are dedicated to a single organization or user group. Private cloud services may be hosted on-premises or by a third-party service provider. |
| [Public Cloud](../../../software-development/cloud/deployment-model/public-cloud.md)| Type of cloud computing in which a service provider makes resources such as virtual machines, applications, or storage available to the general public over the internet. Public cloud services may be free or offered on a pay-per-usage model. |

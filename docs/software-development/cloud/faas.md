## Documentation
Function as a Service (FaaS) is a cloud computing service that allows users to run
pieces of code in response to events or triggers in a serverless deployment. FaaS abstracts the
underlying infrastructure and allows developers to focus on writing and deploying functions that
respond to specific events or triggers.
FaaS is a pay-as-you-go service, with users only paying for the compute time used
to run the functions. FaaS is ideal for event-driven applications, such as IoT
applications, real-time data processing, and webhooks.

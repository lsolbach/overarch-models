## Documentation
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is a cloud service model that provides virtualized
computing resources over the Internet. IaaS provides virtual machines, storage, and networking
resources that can be used to build, deploy, and manage applications in the cloud. It is
essentially a replica of a traditional data center, but hosted and managed by a cloud provider.

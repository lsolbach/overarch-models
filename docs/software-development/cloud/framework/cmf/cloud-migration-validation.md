## Description
Cloud migration validation is the process of verifying that applications, data, and other business elements
          have been successfully migrated to a cloud computing environment and are functioning as expected. Cloud
          migration validation typically involves testing applications, monitoring performance, and validating data
          integrity to ensure a successful migration.

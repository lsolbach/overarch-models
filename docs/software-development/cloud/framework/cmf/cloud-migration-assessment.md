# Cloud Migration Assessment (Concept)
## Description
Cloud migration assessment is the process of evaluating an organization's current environment, workloads,
          and applications to determine their suitability for migration to the cloud. A cloud migration assessment
          typically includes an inventory of existing assets, an analysis of dependencies and interdependencies,
          and a risk assessment to identify potential challenges and opportunities.

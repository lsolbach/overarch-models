## Documentation
Software as a Service (SaaS) is a software distribution model in which a third-party provider hosts applications
and makes them available to customers over the Internet. SaaS is one of three main categories of cloud computing,
alongside Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS). SaaS applications are typically
accessed through a web browser, with users paying a subscription fee to access the software. SaaS applications
are hosted and maintained by the service provider, with updates and maintenance handled by the provider rather
than the end user.

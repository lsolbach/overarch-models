## Documentation
Container as a Service (CaaS) is a cloud computing service that allows users to
manage and deploy containers, which are lightweight, standalone, executable
packages that include everything needed to run an application,
including the code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings.
CaaS provides a platform for running containerized applications in the cloud,
with features such as container orchestration, scaling, and monitoring.
CaaS abstracts the underlying infrastructure and allows developers to focus on
building and deploying containerized applications without worrying about managing
servers or infrastructure.

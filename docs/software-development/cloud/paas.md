Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a cloud service model that provides a platform of services allowing customers to
develop, run, and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure typically

cloud, with resources that allow developers to build, test, and deploy applications based on computing, storage, and
networking services provided by the cloud provider.

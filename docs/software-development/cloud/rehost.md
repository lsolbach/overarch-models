# Rehost (Concept)
## Description
Rehosting, also known as 'lift and shift,' involves moving an application from an on-premises
          environment to the cloud without making any changes to the application itself. This approach is
          often used for applications that are not cloud-native and do not take advantage of cloud-specific
          features.

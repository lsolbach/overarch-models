| [Multi-Cloud](../../software-development/cloud/deployment-model/multi-cloud.md)| A cloud computing strategy that involves using multiple cloud services from different providers. |
| [Private Cloud](../../software-development/cloud/deployment-model/private-cloud.md)| Type of cloud computing in which resources are dedicated to a single organization or user group. Private cloud services may be hosted on-premises or by a third-party service provider. |
| [Public Cloud](../../software-development/cloud/deployment-model/public-cloud.md)| Type of cloud computing in which a service provider makes resources such as virtual machines, applications, or storage available to the general public over the internet. Public cloud services may be free or offered on a pay-per-usage model. |

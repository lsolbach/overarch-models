# Measured service (Concept)
## Description
Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging
          a metering capability1 at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of
          service (e.g., storage, processing, bandwidth, and active user accounts).
          Resource usage can be monitored, controlled, and reported, providing
          transparency for both the provider and consumer of the utilized service.

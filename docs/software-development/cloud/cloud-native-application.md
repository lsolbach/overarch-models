# Cloud Native Application (Concept)
## Description
A cloud-native application is an application that is designed and built specifically for cloud
          environments. Cloud-native applications are typically developed using microservices architecture,
          containerization, and serverless computing to take advantage of the scalability, flexibility, and
          cost-effectiveness of cloud computing.

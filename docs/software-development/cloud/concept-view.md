## Description
Shows the concepts related to Cloud Computing and their relationships.

## Concepts
| Concept | Description |
|---|---|
| [Broad network access](../../software-development/cloud/broad-network-access.md)| Capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms (e.g., mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and workstations). |
| [Cloud Adoption Framework](../../software-development/cloud/cloud-adoption-framework.md)| A set of best practices, guidelines, and tools for organizations to plan, implement, and manage their cloud adoption journey. The framework provides a structured approach to cloud adoption, including assessment, planning, migration, and optimization phases. |
| [Cloud Computing](../../software-development/cloud/cloud-computing.md)| A model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. |
| [Cloud Computing Platform](../../software-development/cloud/cloud-computing-platform.md)| A  set of tools, services, and infrastructure that enables developers to build, deploy, and manage applications on the cloud. Cloud computing platforms may include services such as virtual machines, databases, AI, machine learning, and IoT, as well as developer tools for building and deploying applications. |
| [Cloud Deployment Model](../../software-development/cloud/cloud-deployment-model.md)| Cloud deployment models include Public Cloud, Private Cloud, Hybrid Cloud, and Multi-Cloud. |
| [Cloud Migration Assessment](../../software-development/cloud/cloud-migration-assessment.md)| Cloud migration assessment is the process of evaluating an organization's current environment, workloads, and applications to determine their suitability for migration to the cloud. A cloud migration assessment typically includes an inventory of existing assets, an analysis of dependencies and interdependencies, and a risk assessment to identify potential challenges and opportunities. |
| [Cloud Migration Execution](../../software-development/cloud/cloud-migration-execution.md)| Cloud migration execution is the process of implementing a cloud migration plan and moving applications, data, and other business elements to a cloud computing environment. Cloud migration execution typically involves provisioning cloud resources, migrating data, testing applications, and monitoring performance to ensure a successful migration. |
| [Cloud Migration Optimization](../../software-development/cloud/cloud-migration-optimization.md)| Cloud migration optimization is the process of fine-tuning applications, data, and other business elements in a cloud computing environment to improve performance, reduce costs, and maximize the benefits of cloud migration. Cloud migration optimization typically involves monitoring performance, analyzing usage patterns, and making adjustments to optimize resource utilization and efficiency. |
| [Cloud Migration Plan](../../software-development/cloud/cloud-migration-plan.md)| Cloud migration plan is a detailed roadmap for moving applications, data, and other business elements to a cloud computing environment. A cloud migration plan typically includes a timeline, budget, resource allocation, risk management strategy, and communication plan to ensure a successful migration. |
| [Cloud Migration Strategy](../../software-development/cloud/cloud-migration-strategy.md)| A plan for moving applications, data, and other business elements to a cloud computing environment. A cloud migration strategy typically includes an assessment of the current environment, identification of workloads to be migrated, selection of the appropriate cloud deployment model, and implementation of the migration plan. |
| [Cloud Migration Validation](../../software-development/cloud/cloud-migration-validation.md)| Cloud migration validation is the process of verifying that applications, data, and other business elements have been successfully migrated to a cloud computing environment and are functioning as expected. Cloud migration validation typically involves testing applications, monitoring performance, and validating data integrity to ensure a successful migration. |
| [Cloud Native Application](../../software-development/cloud/cloud-native-application.md)| A cloud-native application is an application that is designed and built specifically for cloud environments. Cloud-native applications are typically developed using microservices architecture, containerization, and serverless computing to take advantage of the scalability, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness of cloud computing. |
| [Cloud Provider](../../software-development/cloud/cloud-provider.md)| A company that offers cloud computing services, such as virtual machines, storage, databases, and applications, to customers over the internet. |
| [Cloud Service Model](../../software-development/cloud/cloud-service-model.md)| The type of service provided by a cloud provider |
| [Landing Zone](../../software-development/cloud/landing-zone.md)| A landing zone is a pre-configured environment in the cloud that provides a foundation for migrating workloads and applications. A landing zone typically includes network configurations, security policies, and governance controls to ensure a secure and compliant cloud environment. |
| [Measured service](../../software-development/cloud/measured-service.md)| Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability1 at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service (e.g., storage, processing, bandwidth, and active user accounts). Resource usage can be monitored, controlled, and reported, providing transparency for both the provider and consumer of the utilized service. |
| [On-demand self-service](../../software-development/cloud/on-demand-self-service.md)| A consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities, such as server time and network storage, as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with each service provider. |
| [Rapid elasticity](../../software-development/cloud/rapid-elasticity.md)| Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released, in some cases automatically, to scale rapidly outward and inward commensurate with demand. To the consumer, the capabilities available for provisioning often appear unlimited and can be appropriated in any quantity at any time. |
| [Resource pooling](../../software-development/cloud/resource-pooling.md)| The provider's computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand. |
| [Well-Architected Framework](../../software-development/cloud/well-architected-framework.md)| A set of best practices and guidelines for designing, building, and optimizing cloud-based applications. The framework provides a structured approach to evaluating the architecture of cloud applications across five pillars: operational excellence, security, reliability, performance efficiency, and cost optimization. |

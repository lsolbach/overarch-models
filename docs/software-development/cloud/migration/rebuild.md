# Rebuild (Concept)
## Description
Rebuilding, also known as 'rearchitect', involves redeveloping an application from scratch using cloud-native technologies and
          services. This approach is used to create a new, cloud-native application that is optimized for the
          cloud and takes advantage of its features and capabilities.

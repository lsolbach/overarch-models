# Lift and Shift (Concept)
## Description
Lift and shift, also known as 'rehost,' involves moving an application from an on-premises environment
          to the cloud without making any changes to the application itself. This approach is often used for
          applications that are not cloud-native and do not take advantage of cloud-specific features.

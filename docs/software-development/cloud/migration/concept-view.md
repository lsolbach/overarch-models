## Description
Shows the concepts related to cloud migration and their relationships.

## Concepts
| Concept | Description |
|---|---|
| [Cloud Migration Strategy](../../../software-development/cloud/cloud-migration-strategy.md)| A plan for moving applications, data, and other business elements to a cloud computing environment. A cloud migration strategy typically includes an assessment of the current environment, identification of workloads to be migrated, selection of the appropriate cloud deployment model, and implementation of the migration plan. |
| [Lift and Shift](../../../software-development/cloud/migration/lift-and-shift.md)| Lift and shift, also known as 'rehost,' involves moving an application from an on-premises environment to the cloud without making any changes to the application itself. This approach is often used for applications that are not cloud-native and do not take advantage of cloud-specific features. |
| [Rearchitect](../../../software-development/cloud/migration/rearchitect.md)| Rearchitecting, also known as 'rebuild', involves redesigning an application to take advantage of cloud-native features and capabilities. This approach is used to optimize an application for the cloud and improve its performance, scalability, and reliability. |
| [Rebuild](../../../software-development/cloud/migration/rebuild.md)| Rebuilding, also known as 'rearchitect', involves redeveloping an application from scratch using cloud-native technologies and services. This approach is used to create a new, cloud-native application that is optimized for the cloud and takes advantage of its features and capabilities. |
| [Refactor](../../../software-development/cloud/migration/refactor.md)| Refactoring, also known as 'replatform,' involves making minor changes to an application before migrating it to the cloud. This approach is used to optimize an application for the cloud without completely redesigning it. |
| [Rehost](../../../software-development/cloud/migration/rehost.md)| Rehosting, also known as 'lift and shift,' involves moving an application from an on-premises environment to the cloud without making any changes to the application itself. This approach is often used for applications that are not cloud-native and do not take advantage of cloud-specific features. |
| [Relocate](../../../software-development/cloud/migration/relocate.md)| Relocating an application to a different cloud provider or region. This approach is used to improve performance, reduce costs, or comply with regulatory requirements by moving an application to a different cloud environment. |
| [Replace](../../../software-development/cloud/migration/replace.md)| Replacing an application with a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software or a cloud-based service. This approach is used to modernize an application and take advantage of new features and capabilities offered by third-party solutions. |
| [Replatform](../../../software-development/cloud/migration/replatform.md)| Replatforming, also known as 'lift, tinker, and shift,' involves making minor changes to an application before migrating it to the cloud. This approach is used to optimize an application for the cloud without completely redesigning it. |
| [Repurchase](../../../software-development/cloud/migration/repurchase.md)| Repurchasing an application by moving from an on-premises deployment to a cloud-based service or vice versa. This approach is used to change the licensing model, reduce costs, or take advantage of new features and capabilities offered by cloud-based services. |
| [Retain](../../../software-development/cloud/migration/retain.md)| Retaining involves keeping an application in its current state and not migrating it to the cloud. This approach is typically used for applications that are not suitable for the cloud due to technical, regulatory, or business constraints. |
| [Retire](../../../software-development/cloud/migration/retire.md)| Retiring involves decommissioning an application that is no longer needed or relevant. This approach is used to reduce the complexity and cost of an organization's application portfolio. |

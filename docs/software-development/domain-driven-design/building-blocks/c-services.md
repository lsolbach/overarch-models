## Documentation
Sometimes, it just isn't a thing.

Some concepts from the domain aren't natural to model as objects. Forcing the
required domain functionality to be the responsibility of an ENTITY or VALUE
either distorts the definition of a model-based object or adds meaningless
artificial objects.

Therefore,

When a significant process or transformation in the domain is not a natural
responsibility of an ENTITY or VALUE OBJECT, add an operation to the model
as a standalone interface declared as a SERVICE. Define a service contract, a
set of assertions about interactions with the service. (See assertions.) State
these assertions in the ubiquitous language of a specific bounded context.
Give the service a name, which also becomes part of the ubiquitous language.

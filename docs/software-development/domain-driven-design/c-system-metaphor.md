# System Metaphor (Concept)
## Description


## Documentation
Metaphorical thinking is pervasive in software development, especially with
models. But the Extreme Programming practice of “metaphor” has come to mean a
particular way of using a metaphor to bring order to the development of a
whole system.

Software designs tend to be very abstract and hard to grasp. Developers and
users alike need tangible ways to understand the system and share a view of the
system as a whole.

Therefore:

When a concrete analogy to the system emerges that captures the imagination of
team members and seems to lead thinking in a useful direction, adopt it as a
large-scale structure. Organize the design around this metaphor and absorb it
into the ubiquitous language. The system metaphor should both facilitate
communication about the system and guide development of it. This increases
consistency in different parts of the system, potentially even across different
bounded contexts. But because all metaphors are inexact, continually reexamine
the metaphor for overextension or inaptness, and be ready to drop it if it gets
in the way.

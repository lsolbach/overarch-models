# Conformist (Concept)
## Description


## Documentation
When two development teams have an upstream/downstream relationship in which the
upstream has no motivation to provide for the downstream team’s needs, the
downstream team is helpless. Altruism may motivate upstream developers to make
promises, but they are unlikely to be fulfilled. Belief in those good
intentions leads the downstream team to make plans based on features that will
never be available. The downstream project will be delayed until the team
ultimately learns to live with what it is given. An interface tailored to the
needs of the downstream team is not in the cards.

Therefore,

Eliminate the complexity of translation between bounded contexts by slavishly
adhering to the model of the upstream team. Although this cramps the style of
the downstream designers and probably does not yield the ideal model for the
application, choosing conformity enormously simplifies integration. Also, you
will share a ubiquitous language with your upstream team. The upstream is in
the driver’s seat, so it is good to make communication easy for them. Altruism
may be sufficient to get them to share information with you.

changing to a completely different type of structure along the way.

## Documentation
Design free-for-alls produce systems no one can make sense of as a whole, and
they are very difficult to maintain. But architectures can straitjacket a
project with up-front design assumptions and take too much power away from the
developers/designers of particular parts of the application. Soon, developers
will dumb down the application to fit the structure, or they will subvert it
and have no structure at all, bringing back the problems of uncoordinated
development.

Therefore:

Let this conceptual large-scale structure evolve with the application, possibly
changing to a completely different type of structure along the way. Don't over
constrain the detailed design and model decisions that must be made with
detailed knowledge.

Large-scale structure should be applied when a structure can be found that
greatly clarifies the system without forcing unnatural constraints on model
development. Because an ill-fitting structure is worse than none, it is best
not to shoot for comprehensiveness, but rather to find a minimal set that
solves the problems that have emerged. Less is more.

What follows is a set of four particular patterns of large-scale structure that
emerge on some projects and are representative of this kind of pattern.

## Documentation
These patterns cast widely held best practices of object-oriented design in the
light of domain-driven design. They guide decisions to clarify the model and to
keep the model and implementation aligned with each other, each reinforcing the
otherâ€™s effectiveness. Careful crafting the details of individual model
elements gives developers a steady platform from which to explore models and to
keep them in close correspondence with the implementation.

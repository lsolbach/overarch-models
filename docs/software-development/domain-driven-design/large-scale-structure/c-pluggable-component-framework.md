## Description
A framework that allows diverse implementations of those interfaces to be
freely substituted.

## Documentation
Opportunities arise in a very mature model that is deep and distilled. A
pluggable component framework usually only comes into play after a few
applications have already been implemented in the same domain.

When a variety of applications have to interoperate, all based on the same
abstractions but designed independently, translations between multiple bounded
contexts limit integration. A shared kernel is not feasible for teams that do
not work closely together. Duplication and fragmentation raise costs of
development and installation, and interoperability becomes very difficult.

Therefore:

Distill an abstract core of interfaces and interactions and create a framework
that allows diverse implementations of those interfaces to be freely
substituted. Likewise, allow any application to use those components, so long
as it operates strictly through the interfaces of the abstract core.

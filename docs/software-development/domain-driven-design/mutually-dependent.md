## Documentation
A situation in which two software development projects in separate contexts
must both be delivered in order for either to be considered a success.
When two systems each rely on information or functionality of the other - something
we would generally try to avoid - naturally we see the projects that build them
as interdependent. Yet there are also mutually dependent projects where system
dependencies run only one direction. When the depended-on system has little
value without the dependent system and the integration with that system
- perhaps because this is the only place it is used -  then a failure to
deliver the dependent system would be a failure of both projects.

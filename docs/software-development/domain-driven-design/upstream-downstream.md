# upsteam-downstream (Concept)
## Description
A relationship between two groups in which the “upstream” group’s actions
affect project success of the “downstream” group, but the actions of the
downstream do not significantly affect projects upstream.

## Documentation
A relationship between two groups in which the “upstream” group’s actions
affect project success of the “downstream” group, but the actions of the
downstream do not significantly affect projects upstream (e.g. If two cities
are along the same river, the upstream city’s pollution primarily affects the
downstream city). The upstream team may succeed independently of the fate of
the downstream team.

## Documentation
Domain-Driven Design is an approach to the development of complex software in which we:

1. Focus on the core domain.
2. Explore models in a creative collaboration of domain practitioners and software practitioners.
3. Speak a ubiquitous language within an explicitly bounded context.

This three-point summary of DDD depends on the definition of the terms, which
are defined in this booklet.

Many projects do modeling work without getting much real benefit in the end.
The patterns of DDD distill successful practices from projects where dramatic
benefits have come from modeling. Taken together, they lay out a quite
different approach to modeling and software development that runs from fine
details to high-level vision. Rigorous modeling conventions must be balanced
with free exploration of models in collaboration with non-technical people.
Tactics and strategy must be combined to succeed, and DDD addresses both
tactical and strategic design.

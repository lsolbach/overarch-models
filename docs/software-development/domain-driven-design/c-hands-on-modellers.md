# Hands On Modellers (Concept)
## Description
Developers must be involved with the model and have contact with domain experts.

## Documentation
If the people who write the code do not feel responsible for the model, or
don't understand how to make the model work for an application, then the model
has nothing to do with the software. If developers don't realize that changing
code changes the model, then their refactoring will weaken the model rather
than strengthen it. Meanwhile, when a modeler is separated from the
implementation process, he or she never acquires, or quickly loses, a feel for
the constraints of implementation.
The basic constraint of MODEL-DRIVEN DESIGN —that the model supports an
effective implementation and abstracts key insights into the domain—
is half-gone, and the resulting models will be impractical. Finally, the
knowledge and skills of experienced designers won't be transferred to other
developers if the division of labor prevents the kind of collaboration that
conveys the subtleties of coding a MODEL-DRIVEN DESIGN.


Therefore,

Any technical person contributing to the model must spend some time touching
the code, whatever primary role he or she plays on the project. Anyone
responsible for changing code must learn to express a model through the code.
Every developer must be involved in some level of discussion about the model
and have contact with domain experts. Those who contribute in different ways
must consciously engage those who touch the code in a dynamic exchange of model
ideas through the UBIQUITOUS LANGUAGE.

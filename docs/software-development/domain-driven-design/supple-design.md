## Documentation
To have a project accelerate as development proceeds — rather than get weighed
down by its own legacy — demands a design that is a pleasure to work with,
inviting to change. A supple design.

Supple design is the complement to deep modeling.

Developers play two roles, each of which must be served by the design. The same
person might well play both roles — even switch back and forth in minutes — but
the relationship to the code is different nonetheless.
One role is the developer of a client, who weaves the domain objects into the
application code or other domain layer code, utilizing capabilities of the
design. A supple design reveals a deep underlying model that makes its potential clear.
The client developer can flexibly use a minimal set of loosely coupled concepts
to express a range of scenarios in the domain. Design elements fit together in
a natural way with a result that is predictable, clearly characterized, and
robust.

Equally important, the design must serve the developer working to
change it. To be open to change, a design must be easy to understand, revealing
that same underlying model that the client developer is drawing on. It must
follow the contours of a deep model of the domain, so most changes bend the
design at flexible points. The effects of its code must be transparently
obvious, so the consequences of a change will be easy to anticipate.
 * Making behavior obvious
 * Reducing the cost of change
 * Creating software developers to work with

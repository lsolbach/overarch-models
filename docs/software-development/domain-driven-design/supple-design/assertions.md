## Description
state post-conditions of operations and invariants of classes and aggregates

## Documentation
When the side effects of operations are only defined implicitly by their
implementation, designs with a lot of delegation become a tangle of cause and
effect. The only way to understand a program is to trace execution through
branching paths. The value of encapsulation is lost. The necessity of tracing
concrete execution defeats abstraction.

Therefore,

State post-conditions of operations and invariants of classes and AGGREGATES.
If assertions cannot be coded directly in your programming language, write
automated unit tests for them. Write them into documentation or diagrams where
it fits the style of the projectâ€™s development process.

Seek models with coherent sets of concepts, which lead a developer to infer the
intended assertions, accelerating the learning curve and reducing the risk of
contradictory code.

Assertions define contracts of services and entity modifiers.

Assertions define invariants on aggregates.

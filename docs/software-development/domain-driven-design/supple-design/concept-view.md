![Concept Map of the Domain Driven Design Supple Design Patterns](../../../software-development/domain-driven-design/supple-design/concept-view.png)

## Description
Shows the supple design patterns and their relationships.

## Concepts
| Concept | Description |
|---|---|
| [Assertions](../../../software-development/domain-driven-design/supple-design/assertions.md)| state post-conditions of operations and invariants of classes and aggregates |
| [Closure of Operations](../../../software-development/domain-driven-design/supple-design/closure-of-operations.md)| define an operation whose return type is the same as the type of its argument(s) |
| [Conceptual Contours](../../../software-development/domain-driven-design/supple-design/conceptual-contours.md)| decompose design elements into cohesive units |
| [Declarative Design](../../../software-development/domain-driven-design/supple-design/declarative-design.md)|  |
| [Established Formalisms](../../../software-development/domain-driven-design/supple-design/established-formalisms.md)|  |
| [Intention-Revealing Interfaces](../../../software-development/domain-driven-design/supple-design/intention-revealing-interfaces.md)| name classes and operations to describe their effect and purpose |
| [Side-Effect-Free Functions](../../../software-development/domain-driven-design/supple-design/side-effect-free-functions.md)| implement logic with functions that return results without observable side effects |
| [Standalone Classes](../../../software-development/domain-driven-design/supple-design/standalone-classes.md)| when possible create classes that are self-contained and can be understood alone |

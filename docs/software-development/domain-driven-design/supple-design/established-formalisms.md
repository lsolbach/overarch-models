## Documentation
Creating a tight conceptual framework from scratch is something you can’t do
every day. Sometimes you discover and refine one of these over the course of
the life of a project. But you can often use and adapt conceptual systems that
are long established in your domain or others, some of which have been refined
and distilled over centuries. Many business applications involve accounting,
for example. Accounting defines a well-developed set of entities and rules that
make for an easy adaptation to a deep model and a supple design.

There are many such formalized conceptual frameworks, but my personal favorite
is math. It is surprising how useful it can be to pull out some twist on basic
arithmetic. Many domains include math somewhere. Look for it. Dig it out.
Specialized math is clean, combinable by clear rules, and people find it easy
to understand.

A real-world example, “Shares Math,” was discussed in Chapter 8 of the book,
Domain-Driven Design.

## Documentation
Even within a module, the difficulty of interpreting a design increases wildly
as dependencies are added. This adds to mental overload, limiting the design
complexity a developer can handle. Implicit concepts contribute to this load
even more than explicit references.
     
Therefore,

Low coupling is fundamental to object design. When you can, go all the way.
Eliminate all other concepts from the picture. Then the class will be
completely self-contained and can be studied and understood alone. Every
such self-contained class significantly eases the burden of understanding a
module.

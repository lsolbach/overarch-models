## Description
define an operation whose return type is the same as the type
of its argument(s)

## Documentation
Most interesting objects end up doing things that can’t be characterized by
primitives alone.

Therefore,

Where it fits, define an operation whose return type is the same as the type
of its argument(s). If the implementer has state that is used in the
computation, then the implementer is effectively an argument of the operation,
so the argument(s) and return value should be of the same type as the
implementer. Such an operation is closed under the set of instances of that
type. A closed operation provides a high-level interface without introducing
any dependency on other concepts.

This pattern is most often applied to the operations of a value object. Because
the life cycle of an entity has significance in the domain, you can’t just
conjure up a new one to answer a question. There are operations that are closed
under an entity type. You could ask an Employee object for its supervisor and
get back another Employee. But in general, entities are not the sort of
concepts that are likely to be the result of a computation. So, for the most
part, this is an opportunity to look for in the value objects.

You sometimes get halfway to this pattern. The argument matches the
implementer, but the return type is different, or the return type matches the
receiver and the argument is different. These operations are not closed, but
they do give some of the advantage of closure, in freeing the mind.

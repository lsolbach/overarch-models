## Documentation
Once your design has intention-revealing interfaces, side-effect-free
functions, and assertions, you are edging into declarative territory. Many of
the benefits of declarative design are obtained once you have combinable
elements that communicate their meaning, and have characterized or obvious
effects, or no observable effects at all.

A supple design can make it possible for the client code to use a declarative
style of design. To illustrate, the next section will bring together some of
the patterns in this chapter to make the specification more supple and
declarative.

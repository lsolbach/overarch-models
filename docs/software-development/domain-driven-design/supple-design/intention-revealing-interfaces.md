## Documentation
If a developer must consider the implementation of a component in order to use
it, the value of encapsulation is lost. If someone other than the original
developer must infer the purpose of an object or operation based on its
implementation, that new developer may infer a purpose that the operation or
class fulfills only by chance. If that was not the intent, the code may work
for the moment, but the conceptual basis of the design will have been
corrupted, and the two developers will be working at cross-purposes.

Therefore,

Name classes and operations to describe their effect and purpose, without
reference to the means by which they do what they promise. This relieves the
client developer of the need to understand the internals. These names should
conform to the ubiquitous language so that team members can quickly infer their
meaning. Write a test for a behavior before creating it, to force your thinking
into client developer mode.

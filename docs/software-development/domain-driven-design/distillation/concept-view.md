## Description
Shows the distilation patterns and their relationships.

## Concepts
| Concept | Description |
|---|---|
| [Abstract Core](../../../software-development/domain-driven-design/distillation/c-abstract-core.md)| The most fundamental differentiating concepts in the model, factored into distinct classes, abstract classes, or interfaces. |
| [Bounded Context](../../../software-development/domain-driven-design/modelling/c-bounded-context.md)| A descrition of a boundary (typically a subsystem or the work of a particular team) within which a particular model is defined and applicable. |
| [Cohesive Mechanisms](../../../software-development/domain-driven-design/distillation/c-cohesive-mechanisms.md)|  |
| [Core Domain](../../../software-development/domain-driven-design/distillation/c-core-domain.md)| The most valuable part of the domain model. |
| [Domain Vision Statement](../../../software-development/domain-driven-design/distillation/c-domain-vision-statement.md)| A short description of the core domain and the value it will bring. |
| [Evolving Order](../../../software-development/domain-driven-design/large-scale-structure/c-evolving-order.md)| A conceptual large-scale structure that evolves with the application, possibly changing to a completely different type of structure along the way. |
| [Generic Subdomains](../../../software-development/domain-driven-design/distillation/c-generic-subdomains.md)| A cohesive subdomain that is not the motivation for the project and does not capoure specialized knowledge. |
| [Highlighted Core](../../../software-development/domain-driven-design/distillation/c-highlighted-core.md)| Describes the core elements of the domain and their interactions. |
| [Segregated Core](../../../software-development/domain-driven-design/distillation/c-segregated-core.md)|  |
| [Ubiquitous Language](../../../software-development/domain-driven-design/modelling/c-ubiquitous-language.md)| A language around the domain model used by all team members within a bounded context to connect all the activities of the team with the software. |

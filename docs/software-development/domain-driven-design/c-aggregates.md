# Aggregates (Concept)
## Description
Aggregates are collections of entities and value objects with their
associations and form a transactional unit. Aggregates are referenced as a
whole by an aggregate root entity, parts of the aggregate must not be
referenced from outside. The aggregate root is responsible for the enforcement
of the busines rules and invariants of the aggregate.

## Documentation
It is difficult to guarantee the consistency of changes to objects in a model
with complex associations. Objects are supposed to maintain their own internal
consistent state, but they can be blindsighed by changes in other objects that
are conceptually constituent parts. Cautious database locking schemes cause
multiple users to interfere pointlessly with each other and can make a system
unusable. Similar issues arise when distributing objects among multiple
servers, or designing asynchronous transactions.

Therefore,

Cluster entities and value objects into aggregates and define boundaries around
each. Choose one entity to be the root of each aggregate, and allow external
objects to hold references to the root only (references to internal members
passed out for use within a single operation only). Define properties and
invariants for the aggregate as a whole and give enforcement responsibility to
the root or some designated framework mechanism.

Use the same aggregate boundaries to govern transactions and distribution.

Within the aggregate boundary, apply consistent rules synchronously. Across
boundaries, handle updates asynchronously.

Keep an aggregate together on one server. Allow diferent aggregate to be
distributed among nodes.

When these design decisions are not beeing guided well by the aggregate
boundaries, reconsider the model. Is the domain scenario hinting at an
important new insight? Such changes often improve the model's expressiveness
and flexibility as well as resolving the transactional and distribution issues.

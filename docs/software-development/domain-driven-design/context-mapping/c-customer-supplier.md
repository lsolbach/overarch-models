## Documentation
When two teams are in an upstream-downstream relationship, where the upstream
team may succeed independently of the fate of the downstream team, the needs of
the downstream come to be addressed in a variety of ways with a wide range of
consequences.

A downstream team can be helpless, at the mercy of upstream priorities.
Meanwhile, the upstream team may be inhibited, worried about breaking
downstream systems.
The problems of the downstream team are not improved by cumbersome change
request procedures with complex approval processes. And the freewheeling
development of the upstream team will stop if the downstream team has veto
power over changes.

Therefore,

Establish a clear customer/supplier relationship between the two teams, meaning
downstream priorities factor into upstream planning. Negotiate and budget tasks
for downstream requirements so that everyone understands the commitment and
schedule.

Agile teams can make the downstream team play the customer role to the upstream
team, in planning sessions. Jointly developed automated acceptance tests can
validate the expected interface from the upstream. Adding these tests to the
upstream team's test suite, to be run as part of its continuous integration,
will free the upstream team to make changes without fear of side effects
downstream.

# Domain Vision Statement (Concept)
## Description
A short description of the core domain and the value it will bring.

## Documentation
At the beginning of a project, the model usually doesn't even exist, yet the
need to focus its development is already there. In later stages of development,
there is a need for an explanation of the value of the system that does not
require an in-depth study of the model. Also, the critical aspects of the
domain model may span multiple bounded contexts, but by definition these
distinct models can't be structured to show their common focus.

Therefore:

Write a short description (about one page) of the core domain and the value it
will bring, the “value proposition”. Ignore those aspects that do not
distinguish this domain model from others. Show how the domain model serves and
balances diverse interests. Keep it narrow. Write this statement early and
revise it as you gain new insight.

# Container View for the simple RESTful Communication Microservices Example

![Container View for the simple RESTful Communication Microservices Example](../../../../software-development/architecture/example/microservices/simple-restful-container-view.png)

## Description
Shows the containers of the simple Microservices Example and their RESTful communication.

## Documentation
With RESTful communication, the services communicateby calling each
         other's RESTful APIs in a request/response pattern.
         The upstream service blocks until the downstream service responds.
         So the services are tightly coupled and the communication is synchronous. 
         If a downstream service is slow, the upstream service has to wait for the
         downstream service and as a result, it also responds slowly.
         If the downstream service is down, the upstream service also fails.
         Also one service has to know the details of the other service's API
         and is responsible for the orchestration of the process.

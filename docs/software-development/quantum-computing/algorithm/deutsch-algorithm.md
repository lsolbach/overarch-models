# Deutsch Algorithm (Concept)
## Description
A quantum algorithm that solves the Deutsch problem, determining if a function is constant or balanced with one query.


## Documentation
Deutsch's algorithm is a foundational quantum algorithm that demonstrates the power of quantum computing over classical computing for specific problems.
         It uses quantum superposition and interference to determine the nature of a function with fewer queries than any classical algorithm could achieve.
         The algorithm operates on a single qubit and uses a quantum oracle to evaluate the function, showcasing the principles of quantum parallelism and entanglement.
         This algorithm is significant in the study of quantum computing as it illustrates the potential for quantum algorithms to outperform classical counterparts in specific tasks.
         It serves as a stepping stone for more complex quantum algorithms and is often one of the first examples introduced in quantum computing education.
         The Deutsch algorithm is a simple yet powerful example of how quantum mechanics can be harnessed for computational advantage.
         It is often used to introduce the concepts of quantum gates, superposition, and measurement in quantum computing courses.

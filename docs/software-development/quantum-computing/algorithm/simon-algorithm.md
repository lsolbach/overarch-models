# Simon Algorithm (Concept)
## Description
A quantum algorithm that solves the Simon problem, finding a hidden period of a function with exponential speedup over classical algorithms.


## Documentation
Simon's algorithm is a quantum algorithm that efficiently solves the Simon problem, which involves finding a hidden period of a function.
         It provides an exponential speedup over classical algorithms, demonstrating the power of quantum computing in solving specific problems.
         The algorithm operates by using quantum superposition and interference to evaluate multiple inputs simultaneously, extracting the hidden period with fewer queries than any classical algorithm could achieve.
         Simon's algorithm is significant in the study of quantum computing as it illustrates the potential for quantum algorithms to outperform classical counterparts in specific tasks.
         It is often used as a prime example in quantum computing education to illustrate the principles of quantum parallelism and the concept of quantum oracles.
         The algorithm has implications in cryptography, particularly in the context of quantum-resistant cryptographic systems, as it can break certain types of encryption based on periodic functions.

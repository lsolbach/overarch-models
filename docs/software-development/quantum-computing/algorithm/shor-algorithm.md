# Shor's Algorithm (Concept)
## Description
A quantum algorithm for integer factorization that runs in polynomial time, breaking RSA encryption.


## Documentation
Shor's algorithm is a groundbreaking quantum algorithm that efficiently factors large integers
         in polynomial time, posing a significant threat to classical cryptographic systems like RSA.
         It operates by using quantum Fourier transform and modular arithmetic to find the period of a function,
         which is crucial for determining the factors of a number.
         The algorithm is particularly effective for large integers, making it a powerful tool in the field of
         quantum computing and cryptography.
         Shor's algorithm is significant in the study of quantum computing as it demonstrates the potential for
         quantum algorithms to outperform classical algorithms in number-theoretic problems.
         It is often used as a prime example in quantum computing education to illustrate the principles of quantum
         parallelism, entanglement, and the concept of quantum oracles.
         The algorithm has far-reaching implications for cryptography, as it can break widely used encryption schemes
         and necessitates the development of new quantum-resistant cryptographic methods.
         Shor's algorithm is a foundational example in quantum computing, illustrating how quantum mechanics can be
         harnessed for computational advantage in number factorization and cryptography.

# Bernstein-Vazirani Algorithm (Concept)
## Description
A quantum algorithm that determines a hidden binary string with a single query to the oracle.


## Documentation
The Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm is a quantum algorithm that efficiently determines a hidden binary string encoded in a quantum oracle.
         It demonstrates the power of quantum computing in solving problems that would require multiple queries in classical computing.
         The algorithm uses quantum superposition and interference to extract the hidden string with only one query, showcasing the principles of quantum parallelism.
         It is a significant example in quantum computing as it highlights the potential for quantum algorithms to outperform classical algorithms in specific tasks.
         The Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm is often used in educational contexts to illustrate the advantages of quantum computing and the concept of quantum oracles.
         It serves as a foundational example in the study of quantum algorithms, illustrating how quantum mechanics can be harnessed for computational advantage.

## Documentation
The Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) is a quantum algorithm that efficiently computes the discrete Fourier transform
          on quantum states, playing a crucial role in many quantum algorithms, including Shor's algorithm.
          It operates by transforming a quantum state into its frequency domain representation, allowing for efficient
          manipulation and analysis of quantum information.
          The QFT is significant in the study of quantum computing as it demonstrates the power of quantum parallelism and interference,
          enabling the extraction of periodicity and other properties from quantum states.
          It is often used as a foundational example in quantum computing education to illustrate the principles of quantum
          algorithms and the concept of quantum gates.
          The QFT is applicable in various fields, including cryptography, signal processing, and quantum simulation,
          where efficient Fourier transforms are essential for analyzing and processing quantum data.
          The algorithm is a key component in many quantum algorithms, showcasing how quantum mechanics can be leveraged
          for computational advantage in tasks that involve periodicity and frequency analysis.
          The Quantum Fourier Transform is a foundational example in quantum computing, illustrating the principles of quantum
          parallelism and the potential for quantum algorithms to outperform classical counterparts in specific tasks.

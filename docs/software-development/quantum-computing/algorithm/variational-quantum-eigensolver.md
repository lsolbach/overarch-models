## Description
A hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for finding the ground state energy of a quantum system.


## Documentation
The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm designed to find the ground state energy of a quantum system.
         It combines classical optimization techniques with quantum computing to efficiently explore the energy landscape of quantum systems.
         VQE operates by preparing a parameterized quantum state and using classical optimization algorithms to minimize the energy expectation value,
         allowing for the determination of the ground state energy with high precision.
         The algorithm is particularly useful in quantum chemistry, material science, and optimization problems, where finding the ground state energy is essential.
         VQE demonstrates the power of hybrid quantum-classical approaches, showcasing how quantum mechanics can be leveraged for computational advantage in solving complex problems.
         It is often used as a foundational example in quantum computing education to illustrate the principles of variational methods, quantum gates, and the concept of quantum oracles.
         The Variational Quantum Eigensolver is a key component in many quantum algorithms, illustrating how hybrid approaches can outperform classical counterparts in specific tasks,
         particularly in the realm of quantum simulation and optimization.

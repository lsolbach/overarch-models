## Description
A quantum algorithm that estimates the eigenvalues of a unitary operator, used in many quantum algorithms.


## Documentation
Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) is a quantum algorithm that estimates the eigenvalues of a unitary operator,
          playing a crucial role in many quantum algorithms, including Shor's algorithm and quantum simulation.
          It operates by preparing a quantum state and applying controlled unitary operations to extract phase information,
          allowing for the estimation of eigenvalues with high precision.
          QPE is significant in the study of quantum computing as it demonstrates the power of quantum parallelism and interference,
          enabling the extraction of spectral properties from quantum states.
          It is often used as a foundational example in quantum computing education to illustrate the principles of quantum
          algorithms and the concept of quantum gates.
          The algorithm is applicable in various fields, including quantum chemistry, optimization, and machine learning,
          where estimating eigenvalues is essential for analyzing and processing quantum data.
          Quantum Phase Estimation is a key component in many quantum algorithms, showcasing how quantum mechanics can be
          leveraged for computational advantage in tasks that involve spectral analysis and eigenvalue estimation.
          It is a foundational example in quantum computing, illustrating the principles of quantum parallelism and the potential
          for quantum algorithms to outperform classical counterparts in specific tasks.

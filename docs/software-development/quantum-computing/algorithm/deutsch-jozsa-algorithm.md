# Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm (Concept)
## Description
A quantum algorithm that generalizes the Deutsch algorithm to determine if a function is constant or balanced with fewer queries.


## Documentation
The Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm extends the Deutsch algorithm to handle functions with multiple inputs, allowing it to determine if a function is constant or balanced with only one query.
           It demonstrates the power of quantum computing in solving problems that would require exponentially more queries in classical computing.
           The algorithm uses quantum superposition and interference to evaluate the function, showcasing the principles of quantum parallelism.
           It is a significant example in quantum computing as it highlights the potential for quantum algorithms to outperform classical algorithms in specific tasks.
           The Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm is often used in educational contexts to illustrate the advantages of quantum computing and the concept of quantum oracles.

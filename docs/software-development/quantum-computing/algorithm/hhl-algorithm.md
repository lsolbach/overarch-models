# HHL Algorithm (Concept)
## Description
A quantum algorithm for solving linear systems of equations, providing exponential speedup over classical algorithms.


## Documentation
The HHL algorithm, named after its inventors Harrow, Hassidim, and Lloyd, is a quantum algorithm designed to solve linear systems of equations.
         It provides an exponential speedup over classical algorithms for certain types of linear systems, making it
         a significant breakthrough in quantum computing.
         The algorithm operates by encoding the linear system into a quantum state and using quantum phase estimation to
         extract the solution efficiently.
         HHL is particularly useful for problems in quantum chemistry, optimization, and machine learning, where
         solving linear systems is a common task.
         It demonstrates the power of quantum parallelism and interference, showcasing how quantum mechanics can be
         harnessed for computational advantage in solving complex mathematical problems.
         The HHL algorithm is often used as a prime example in quantum computing education to illustrate the
         principles of quantum algorithms, quantum gates, and the concept of quantum oracles.
         It is a foundational example in quantum computing, illustrating how quantum algorithms can outperform classical
         algorithms in specific tasks, particularly in the realm of linear algebra and numerical analysis.
